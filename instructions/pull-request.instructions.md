# Pull request instructions

These instructions define how to fill out the pull request template file at [pull_request_template.md](.github/pull_request_template.md).

## Required description

- Always complete the "Description" section in the template.
- Write the description as a list for easier reading.
- Treat the "Description" content as the source of truth for summarizing changes.
- Do not leave any "TODO" text or empty fields in this section.

## Type of change

- Check at least one relevant box in "Type of Change".
- If none apply, check "Documentation update".

## Quality

- Ensure the description explains the why and the what in 2 to 5 sentences.
- Avoid vague phrasing like "miscellaneous changes".
